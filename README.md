# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

This repository contains a collection of C programs with the goal of implementing the stack and queue data structures, implementing both Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) behavior.
In computer science these data structures can be used in various applications, from algorithm development to solving real-world problems. This is a project part of the ALX SE curriculum.

## Stacks

In computer science, a stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. The repository contains C programs that implement stack data structures and common operations such as push, pop, and peek.

## Queues

A queue is another linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. This repository also includes C programs for queue data structures, including enqueue, dequeue, and front operations.
